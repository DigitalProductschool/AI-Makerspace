# [AI Makerspace](https://github.com/DigitalProductschool/AI-Makerspace) 
## We support rapid prototyping of user-centered AI applications. ü§ù

Advances in innovation of AI tools and technologies enable us to solve problems faster, easier, and more effectively. As the technologies grow in complexity and diversity, we experience a growing need for guiding innovation teams through rapid  prototyping and user-centred development. 

AI Makerspace repository is a hub of blueprint templates for using state-of-the-art technologies in the rapid prototyping of AI use cases. Working closely with cross-functional innovation teams at [Digital Product School](https://digitalproductschool.io/) of [UnternehmerTUM](https://www.unternehmertum.de/en), we guide the teams through AI Design Thinking/Engineering, Lean AI Engineering, Explainable AI (XAI), Responsible and Ethical AI, as well as User Experience (UX) of machine learning products. 

In addition, we are on an exciting journey to develop scalable coaching solutions through our üöÄ [Agentic AI Coaching project](https://github.com/DigitalProductschool/AgenticAICoach) üöÄ, and we warmly invite you to contribute and be a part of this initiative.
