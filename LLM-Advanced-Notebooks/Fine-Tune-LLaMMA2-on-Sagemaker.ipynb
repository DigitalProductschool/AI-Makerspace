    "\n",
    "In this sagemaker example, we are going to learn how to fine-tune [LLaMA 2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-hf) using [QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314). [LLaMA 2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-hf) is the next version of the [LLaMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971). Compared to the V1 model, it is trained on more data - 2T tokens and supports context length window upto 4K tokens. Learn more about LLaMa 2 in the [\"\"]() blog post.\n",

    "QLoRA is an efficient finetuning technique that quantizes a pretrained language model to 4 bits and attaches small “Low-Rank Adapters” which are fine-tuned. This enables fine-tuning of models with up to 65 billion parameters on a single GPU; despite its efficiency, QLoRA matches the performance of full-precision fine-tuning and achieves state-of-the-art results on language tasks.\n",

    "We are going to use the recently introduced method in the paper \"[QLoRA: Quantization-aware Low-Rank Adapter Tuning for Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685)\" by Tim Dettmers et al. QLoRA is a new technique to reduce the memory footprint of large language models during finetuning, without sacrificing performance. The TL;DR; of how QLoRA works is: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Quantize the pretrained model to 4 bits and freezing it.\n",
    "* Attach small, trainable adapter layers. (LoRA)\n",
    "* Finetune only the adapter layers, while using the frozen quantized model for context.\n",
    "\n",
    "We prepared a [run_clm.py](./scripts/run_clm.py), which implements QLora using PEFT to train our model. The script also merges the LoRA weights into the model weights after training. That way you can use the model as a normal model without any additional code. The model will be temporally offloaded to disk, if it is too large to fit into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create a sagemaker training job we need an `HuggingFace` Estimator. The Estimator handles end-to-end Amazon SageMaker training and deployment tasks. The Estimator manages the infrastructure use. \n",
    "SagMaker takes care of starting and managing all the required ec2 instances for us, provides the correct huggingface container, uploads the provided scripts and downloads the data from our S3 bucket into the container at `/opt/ml/input/data`. Then, it starts the training job by running.\n",

    "### Harwarde requirements\n",
