## We support your entrepreneurship experience ðŸš€

Advances in innovation of AI tools and technologies enable us to solve problems faster, easier, and more effectively. As the technologies grow in complexity and diversity, we experience a growing need for guiding innovation teams through fast prototyping and user-centred development. 

AI Makerspace is a hub of user-centered AI applications. We provide blueprints to build AI use cases with advanced technologies. Working closely with cross-functional innovation teams at [Digital Product School](https://digitalproductschool.io/) of [UnternehmerTUM](https://www.unternehmertum.de/en), we guide the teams through AI Design Thinking/Engineering, Lean AI Engineering, Explainable AI (XAI), Ethical AI, as well as User Experience (UX) of machine learning products. 

:octocat: Each folder of our GitHub repository is self explanatory and offers templates for prototyping with a selected technology and application.
