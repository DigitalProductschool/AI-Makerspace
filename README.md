Advances in innovation of AI tools and technologies enable us to solve problems faster, easier, and more effectively. As the technologies grow in complexity and diversity, we experience a growing need for guiding innovation teams through fast prototyping and user-centred development. 

AI Makerspace offers a platform to create an exposure gallery and provide templates to build AI use cases with advanced and fundamental technologies. Working closely with cross-functional innovation teams at [Digital Product School](https://digitalproductschool.io/), we guide the teams through AI Design Thinking, Lean AI Engineering, Explainable AI (XAI), Ethical AI, as well as User Experience (UX) of AI products. 

:octocat: Each folder of our GitHub repository is self explanatory and offers templates for prototyping for a selected technology and application. 

Enjoy & Rock!
