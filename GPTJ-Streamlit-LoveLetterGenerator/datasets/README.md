Test Prompt:
```text
input: My Bunny Pie

output: The way my feelings grow for you daily amazes me. I have never loved like this before this time. Nothing takes my breath away than looking up and seeing you stare straight at me. It makes my heart skip beats and blood to run through my veins two times faster.\nYou love me, and I love you very much. That’s a magical bond we share, and I will give up anything to keep that forever.\nI long for your kisses, tender touches, and I can’t hold back any part of me from falling in love with you. I’m surrendering myself to your affection and care because it’s the sweetest and purest thing I’ve ever received. You make my day bright, and my face glows. You make me wish that our lives will last till eternity. Ever since our paths crossed, I’ve been under your sweet doses of love, and it is the most remarkable thing in the world.
