# Gradio with HuggingFace ðŸ¤—

Gradio is an open-source Python framework that allows us to quickly prototype Machine Learning models using web interfaces.

## Goal

In this project we are buidling **question-answering system** **gradio** web-app. Gradio allows us to quickly produce a demo of machine learning models in action. It is incredibly simple to code, as an interface can be created with only a few lines of code.

### Project Structure

```bash
Question Answering-Gradio

```

### Project Requirements

- A Google account, to access the Colab notebook

### Project Steps

- `Step 1`: Open the [Colab notebook](link-to-colab-notebook) in Google Colab by clicking on the link.

- `Step 2`: Make a copy of the notebook by going to "File" > "Save a copy in Drive".

- `Step 3`: Run the code in the notebook by clicking on the play button or pressing Shift+Enter.

- `Step 4`: Once you have your model ready and running, you get a web link of the app deployed on Gradio servers.
