1. Introduction
Welcome to AssemblyAI! Your use of AssemblyAI's services, including the services AssemblyAI makes available through this website and all related web sites, mobile sites, data files, visualizations and applications which link to these terms of service (the "Site") and to all software or services offered by AssemblyAI in connection with any of those (the "Services"), is governed by these terms of service (the "Terms"), so please carefully read them before using the Services. For the purposes of these Terms, "we," "our," "us," and "AssemblyAI" refer to AssemblyAI, Inc., the providers and operators of the Services.
In order to use the Services, you must first agree to these Terms. If you are registering for or using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and promising that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms. In that case, "you" and "your" will also refer to that organization, wherever possible.
You must be over 13 years of age to use the Services, and children under the age of 13 cannot use or register for the Services. If you are over 13 years of age but are not yet of legal age to form a binding contract (in many jurisdictions, this age is 18), then you must get your parent or guardian to read these Terms and agree to them for you before you use the Services. If you are a parent or guardian and you provide your consent to your child's registration with the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms with respect of your child's use of the Services.
You agree your purchases and/or use of the Services are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by AssemblyAI or any of its affiliates regarding future functionality or features.
