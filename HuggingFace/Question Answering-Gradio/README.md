# Gradio with HuggingFace ðŸ¤—

Gradio is an open-source Python framework that allows us to quickly prototype Machine Learning models using web interfaces.

## Goal

In this project we are buidling **question-answering system** **gradio** web-app. Gradio allows us to quickly produce a demo of machine learning models in action. It is incredibly simple to code, as an interface can be created with only a few lines of code.

### Project Structure

```bash
Question Answering-Gradio

â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt

```

### Project Steps

To get Gradio running with a simple "Hello, World" example, follow these three steps:

1\. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DigitalProductschool/AI-Makerspace.git

```
2\. Changing working directory to Question Answering-Gradio:

```bash
cd AI-Makerspace/HuggingFace/Question Answering-Gradio

```

3\. Create a virtual environment for your project:

```bash
python -m venv venv

```
4\. Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
cd venv/Scripts
./activate

```

5\. Install the pre-requisites using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6\. Run the code app.py as a Python script or in a [Google Colab](https://github.com/sanaghani12/AI-Makerspace/blob/Gradio-HuggingFace/HuggingFace/Question%20Answering-Gradio/Huggingface_Gradio_Workshop_DPS.ipynb):

```bash
py .\app.py
```

7\. The demo below will appear automatically within the Colab Notebook, or pop in a browser on [http://localhost:7860](http://localhost:7860) if running from a script:
