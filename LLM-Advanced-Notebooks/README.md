# LLM-Advanced-Notebooks

## Description
This folder contains advanced notebooks focusing on Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Terminology
- **Cypher**: [Cypher Query Language](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/) - A graph query language.
- **Deci**: [Deci's Infery Library](https://deci.ai/blog/accelerating-generative-ai-models-with-infery-by-deci/) - A platform offering an optimization library designed to accelerate and improve the efficiency of generative AI models, including LLMs.
- **KG**: [Knowledge Graph](https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/knowledge-graphs-on-aws/) - A graph-structured knowledge base for storing information.
- **LangChain**: [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) - A tool for leveraging language models in querying applications.
- **LLM**: [Large Language Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) - A general term for machine learning models trained on a large dataset for various natural language processing tasks.
- **PEFT**: [Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning](https://huggingface.co/blog/peft) - A technique for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained language models.
- **QLoRA**: [Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs](https://huggingface.co/blog/4bit-transformers-bitsandbytes) - A technique for efficient fine-tuning of large language models.
- **RAG**: [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/jumpstart-foundation-models-customize-rag.html) - A method that combines retrieval and generation in language models.
- **Text2Cypher**: A technique for converting natural language queries into Cypher queries.
- **Text2GraphQuery**: A technique for converting natural language queries into graph queries.
