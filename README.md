## We support rapid prototyping of human-centred AI use cases. ðŸš€

Advances in innovation of AI tools and technologies enable us to solve problems faster, easier, and more effectively. As the technologies grow in complexity and diversity, we experience a growing need for guiding innovation teams through rapid  prototyping and user-centred development. 

AI Makerspace repository is a hub of blueprint templates for using state-of-the-art technologies in the rapid prototyping of AI use cases. Working closely with cross-functional innovation teams at [Digital Product School](https://digitalproductschool.io/) of [UnternehmerTUM](https://www.unternehmertum.de/en), we guide the teams through AI Design Thinking/Engineering, Lean AI Engineering, Explainable AI (XAI), Responsible and Ethical AI, as well as User Experience (UX) of machine learning products. 

:octocat: Each folder of our GitHub repository is self-explanatory for using the blueprint templates of selected technologies and AI use cases. 

:boom: In addition, you can find our curated list of resources to help AI prototyping on our Wiki page: [Curated AI Resources](https://github.com/DigitalProductschool/AI-Makerspace/wiki/Welcome-to-Curated-AI-Resources!-%F0%9F%9A%80)
