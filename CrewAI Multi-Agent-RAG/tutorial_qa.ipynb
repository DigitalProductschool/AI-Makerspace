    "# Multi-Agent RAG System Using Crew AI for Tutorial Question Answering\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's learning process, especially when exploring new frameworks or tools, we often rely on multiple resources. For example, when watching a YouTube tutorial, the video often contains valuable insights. Additionally, the tutorial description usually includes a link to a GitHub repository, and there is often an accompanying documentation website. If we have further questions, we can search the internet for more specific answers. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the challenge arises when we need to seek answers to specific questions. Typically, we have to manually search through the YouTube video, navigate the GitHub repository, explore the documentation, and search the internet individually. This can be time-consuming and inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "This **Multi Agent - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** aims to streamline that process. Using Crew AI, we can automatically extract relevant information from:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The YouTube video\n",
    "- The GitHub repository\n",
    "- The documentation website\n",
    "- An internet search\n",
    "\n",
    "The system compiles the extracted information to generate a comprehensive answer to the user's query, thereby enhancing the learning process and providing more efficient access to knowledge. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this multi-agent RAG system, you no longer need to search each resource manually. Instead, the system will retrieve and compile the most relevant information from all available sources to answer your query, providing a smoother and faster learning experience."

      "   - **Inherit from BaseTool**: Start by inheriting from the `BaseTool` class. This is the foundation upon which your custom tool will be built.\n",
      "\n",
      "     ```python\n",
      "     from crewai_tools import BaseTool\n",
      "\n",
