I know the circumstances make things be this way. I try to conform myself but I can´t, because every time you go away, it is more evident how dependent I am of your love. I want you back, quickly, very quickly… Don´t let me suffer any longer and come back to my arms and to my love."}

I want you close to me, whispering in my ear… Hurry back, my love! And be sure of one thing: when you return, you will feel like the most loved person on earth; this letter is just a sample, just a little drop of all the love you will be getting when you are back into my arms! Hurry back, my darling! Hurry back, my love!"}

As I´ve said everything reminds me of you. The flower shop in the corner: the chair at the restaurant, empty, the ice-cream shop, where we spent so many sweet moments, the pillow where I found a string of your hair…everything reminds me of you, everything reinforces the sensation of loss. The loss I feel when you are away! But there’s something that hurts me too much: looking at your picture and seeing you smile and so lovely. If you knew how much I miss that timid smile that was always upon your lips, you’d come back as soon as possible, and as soon as you got here you’d realize how much I love you."}
{"input": "My darling", "output": "My love, I have little to say to you right now, but this little means a lot: I miss you and I long for you. I miss you deeply. I wish I were by your side right now, I wish I could feel your breathing really close to me, I wish I could see the sun reflecting in your eyes, I wish I could feel your hand in my hand. I miss your voice, I miss walking with you hand in hand, our finger entangled/intertwined, I miss your skin and I miss your sweet presence. I hope this agony will not last forever and I hope we can meet very soon so I can tell you, face to face, how much I care about you. With a kiss, (name)."}

The fact that I have you in my life, to love and to hold makes me feel alive and you my dear make me feel blessed to have you. Happy Valentine’s Day."}

Having met you in my life is like finding a needle in the field full of grass. No one has a perfect past, and everyone has a sad story to tell, you never got tired of listening to mine. You make me believe that I am worth loving despite my imperfections. I never saw you wanting to give up on me even if there were times I was under the weather. I just want to tell you that I am more than happy and thankful to have you in my life. I love you so much."}
