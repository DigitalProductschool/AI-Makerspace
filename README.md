# [AI Makerspace](https://github.com/DigitalProductschool/AI-Makerspace) 
## We support your entrepreneurship experience.

Advances in innovation of AI tools and technologies enable us to solve problems faster, easier, and more effectively. As the technologies grow in complexity and diversity, we experience a growing need for guiding innovation teams through fast prototyping and user-centred development. 

AI Makerspace offers a platform to create an exposure gallery and provide templates to build AI use cases with advanced and fundamental technologies. Working closely with cross-functional innovation teams at [Digital Product School](https://digitalproductschool.io/) of [UnternehmerTUM](https://www.unternehmertum.de/en), we guide the teams through AI Design Thinking/Engineering, Lean AI Engineering, Explainable AI (XAI), Ethical AI, as well as User Experience (UX) of AI products.

:octocat: Each folder of our GitHub repository is self explanatory and offers templates for prototyping with a selected technology and application. 

Enjoy & Rock!
