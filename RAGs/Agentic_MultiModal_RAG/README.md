# Agentic MultiModal RAG


Agentic MultiModal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines language models and retrieval systems to handle multimodal data (e.g., text and images) for tasks that involve both document indexing and querying. This setup enhances the traditional RAG framework by adding agents that automatically determine the user's intent and route the task accordingly. This approach is highly useful for managing and retrieving information from complex, multimedia documents, such as PDFs containing both text and images.
